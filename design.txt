bjbtask design notes
====================

The initial implementation only uses a text (description) field

Now this is working the information stored will be expanded

For example
  Context
  Priority
  Due date
  Start date
  
Will need special command line syntax / handling for all of these
  Context will use the common @context syntax
  		  @context must either be before or after the distription text (may change later!)

Will need to change the "database" to store a set of lists rather than a set of text lines

Will need to decide how to display the relevant information via the show command
